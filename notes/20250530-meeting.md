## Identifying Market Makers
- Large order sizes
- Take both sides of trade
    - Trying to profit off bid-ask spread rather than taking a specific position on an outcome
- Open positions across all markets represent a small percentage of their total volume
- Make frequent trades


Lower volume

high win rates
baseball


low active positions (<100)
- indicates they probably aren't market makers


## Identifying Sharps
- Is it active or not

45% - 65% win rate
postive pnl
