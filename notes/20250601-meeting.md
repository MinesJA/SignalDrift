# Sports Betting Trading Algorithm - Development Plan

## Overview

Building a sophisticated sports betting arbitrage and market-making system that combines:
1. **Market Making**: Use weighted average "fair odds" from sharp books to make markets on exchanges
2. **+EV Trading**: Identify and exploit pricing discrepancies across different platforms

## Strategy Summary

Create a weighted average of no-vig odds from sharp sportsbooks (FanDuel, Betfair, Circa, Pinnacle) to serve as a fair market price for market making on exchanges, while simultaneously identifying arbitrage opportunities across platforms including prediction markets like Polymarket.

## Step-by-Step Action Plan

### Phase 1: Data Infrastructure & Collection

#### 1. Set up data sources and APIs
- **Betfair Exchange API** (primary liquidity source)
- **Pinnacle API** (if available) or scraping
- **FanDuel API/scraping**
- **Circa Sports** data access
- **Polymarket API** integration
- Consider third-party aggregators (OddsJam, The Odds API)

#### 2. Build real-time data pipeline
- WebSocket connections where available (Betfair, Polymarket)
- REST API polling for others with appropriate rate limiting
- Data normalization layer (convert all odds formats to consistent format)
- Latency measurement and monitoring

### Phase 2: Core Pricing Engine

#### 3. Implement odds conversion utilities
- American ↔ Decimal ↔ Implied Probability converters
- Vig removal algorithms
- Handle different market types (moneyline, spreads, totals)

#### 4. Build weighted averaging system
- Configurable weights per sportsbook
- Quality scoring based on liquidity, update frequency, market efficiency
- Dynamic weight adjustment based on market conditions

#### 5. Fair value calculation engine
- Weighted no-vig probability calculations
- Convert back to various odds formats for different exchanges
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty measurements

### Phase 3: Opportunity Detection

#### 6. Arbitrage detection system
- Cross-platform price comparison
- Account for transaction costs and exchange fees
- Minimum profit threshold settings
- Risk assessment (liquidity, timing, counterparty)

#### 7. Market making opportunity identification
- Identify thin markets where you can provide liquidity
- Calculate optimal bid/ask spreads based on fair value
- Monitor existing order books for gaps

### Phase 4: Risk Management & Position Sizing

#### 8. Risk management framework
- Position sizing algorithms
- Exposure limits per market/sport/exchange
- Correlation analysis between positions
- Stop-loss and profit-taking rules

#### 9. Latency and execution analysis
- Measure end-to-end execution times
- A/B test different execution strategies
- Implement circuit breakers for high-latency scenarios

### Phase 5: Trading Execution

#### 10. Order management system
- Multi-exchange order routing
- Partial fill handling
- Order cancellation and modification
- Position tracking across platforms

#### 11. Automated trading logic
- Market making algorithms (place bids/asks around fair value)
- Arbitrage execution (immediate cross-platform trades)
- Portfolio rebalancing

## Recommended Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python (pandas, numpy for data, asyncio for concurrency)
- **Real-time data**: WebSockets with asyncio or similar
- **Database**: TimescaleDB or ClickHouse for time-series data
- **Message Queue**: Redis or RabbitMQ for order routing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for system metrics

## Core Algorithm Components

### Weighted Fair Value Calculation

```python
# Example weights (adjustable)
weights = {
    'pinnacle': 0.35,
    'circa': 0.30,
    'betfair': 0.25,
    'fanduel': 0.10
}

# For each bookmaker:
# 1. Convert to implied probability
implied_prob = 1 / decimal_odds

# 2. Remove vig
no_vig_prob = prob / sum_of_probs

# 3. Calculate weighted average
weighted_prob = sum(no_vig_prob[book] * weights[book] for book in books)

# 4. Convert back to fair odds
fair_odds = 1 / weighted_prob
```

### Market Making Strategy
- Post prices slightly better than fair price to attract fills
- Set desired margin or edge (offer at +EV)
- Adjust exposure dynamically based on liquidity shifts

### Arbitrage Strategy
- Monitor price discrepancies across platforms
- Execute immediate cross-platform trades when profitable
- Account for transaction costs and execution latency

## Key Considerations

### Latency Requirements (Aaron's Point)
- **Critical**: Measure end-to-end execution times
- **Example**: If data pull (1s) + analysis (0.5s) + order placement (0.5s) = 2s total
- Must account for market movement speed when setting profit thresholds
- Consider co-location or premium data feeds for competitive advantage

### Risk Factors
- API rate limits and potential outages
- Exchange fees and transaction costs
- Counterparty risk on different platforms
- Regulatory compliance across jurisdictions
- Capital requirements for market making

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Foundation
1. **Start with data collection** - Get basic API connections working for 2-3 sources
2. **Build core odds conversion utilities** - Essential foundation component
3. **Create simple arbitrage detector** - Test with manual trades first

### Priority 2: Optimization
4. **Measure and optimize latency** - Critical for competitive success
5. **Implement basic risk management** - Position sizing and exposure limits
6. **Build monitoring and alerting** - System health and opportunity notifications

## Success Metrics

- **Latency**: Sub-second opportunity detection and execution
- **Accuracy**: Fair value calculations within 1-2% of market consensus
- **Profitability**: Consistent positive ROI after transaction costs
- **Uptime**: 99%+ system availability during market hours
- **Risk**: Maximum drawdown within predefined limits

## Notes from Team Discussion

- **Nicholas**: Focus on weighted average from sharp books, mixture of +EV and market making
- **Aaron**: Latency is critical - must test execution speeds across all platforms
- **Jonathan**: Starting with odds collection from target sportsbooks

## Target Markets (Initial)
- MLB (example: Tigers vs Royals shown in screenshots)
- NFL (high liquidity)
- NBA (frequent games, good for testing)
- Major soccer leagues (international opportunities)
