# User Identification

## Thesis
Calculate the average probability that if you were to take a position at a random price in a particular market that you would have an opportunity to sell that position at a later time for x% more than you purchased it for.

Can even calculate the chance you can sell for multiple gains (5% profit, 10%, 15%, 30%?)

Then calculate how often a particular user bought at a price that allowed them to sell at the same profit margin.

The difference in those chances would be the metric by which to judge the strength of the signal.

| user     | <= 5% | <= 10% | <= 15% | <= 20% |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| average  | 30%   | 30%    | 30%    |  30%   |
| user_a   | 40%   | 40%    | 40%    |  40%   |
| user_b   | 40%   | 40%    | 40%    |  40%   |
